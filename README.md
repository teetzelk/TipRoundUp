# TipRoundUp
My wife likes to have even numbers when tipping, so I made a basic program (to start to learn python) that takes the amount of the check, plus the tip percent and rounds it all up so the final amount is a "whole" number ($$$.00).

I've used Anvil.Works to make it accessable to anybody to use (not really pretty - once I get a better understanding of Python I'll work on understanding Anvil)
